Should the function "tic_tac_toe_check" be wrapped in a class? Can "impl.py" contain additional helper functions?

Is the list of strings being passed to the function one-dimensional, or two-dimensional?

Do the first three elements make up the first row of the tic-tac-toe board (from left to right), the next three elements make up the second row, etc.? If not, how are the elements of the list mapped to the tic-tac-toe board?

Is the tic-tac-toe board assumed to be 3x3 spaces?

How should I handle an empty list being passed to the function?

How should I handle a list that contains data types other than strings?

How should I handle a list with a number of strings that is not equal to the number of spaces on the tic-tac-board?

How should I handle a non-list being passed to the function (an int, for example)?

How should the function behave when it is called without any parameters? Will that ever happen?

How is a black space on the tic-tac-toe board represented in the list? An empty string, perhaps?

Is it assumed that there will only be two symbols in play on the board at one time? Can there be more than two?

Will the symbols be "X" and "O" as is traditional, or can they be any string?

Are the symbol strings case sensitive?

Should the winning symbol be returned as a string? Is this string case sensitive?

What should the function return if no symbol has a winning pattern?

What should the function return if multiple symbols have winning patterns?

How are the empty spaces on the board represented (spaces that have not yet been played on)? An empty string, perhaps?

How should the function handle the presence of more than two symbols?

How should the function handle the presence of symbols that are not “x” or “o”?

How should the function handle the presence of multiple winning patterns by the same symbol (two three-in-a-row patterns by “x”, for example)?
